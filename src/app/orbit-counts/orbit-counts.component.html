<h3>Satellite Count:</h3>
<div class="counts">
	<div>Total: <span class="counts-total">{{satellites.length}}</span></div>

	<!-- Bonus 2b Note to Self: I copied line above and modified it below with an *ngFor to loop thru 
		and display the number of each type using the types[] array I created on orbit-counts.component.ts  -->
	<div *ngFor="let type of types">{{type}}: <span class="counts-total" >{{countByType(type)}}</span></div>

</div>

<!-- TODO 4: add logic to count number of satellites displayed -->

<!-- Note to Self: I needed to replace NAN with placeholder {{satellites.length}} making 
	sure to use satellites plural to represent the new property declared on app.component.ts and
	to be added to both orbit-list and orbit-counts components in their .ts files. -->
