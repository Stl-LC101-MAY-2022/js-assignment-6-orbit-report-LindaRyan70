<!-- TODO 4: add logic to count number of satellites displayed -->

<!-- Note to Self: I needed to replace NAN with placeholder {{satellites.length}} making 
	sure to use satellites plural to represent the new property declared on app.component.ts and
	to be added to both orbit-list and orbit-counts components in their .ts files. -->
